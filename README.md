This is a **research review** about smart contract's **security and privacy** issues. It focuses mainly on Ethereum and it is suited to people just starting in the crypto world but who have already a technical background. 

In case you are already a blockchain enthusiast, there is a fairly thorough aggregation of **useful references** on the topic at the end of the report.
